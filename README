SquidControlServer
==================

This is a Project to secure a network like a wireless network.

NOTE: the project is still in the phase of completion since I have to finalize some things.
Altough I have tried my best to make all the subprojects loosely coupled from each other.
Each subpoject is in a different folder so that if different teams are allocated the same project they can do it without disturbing the other sub-projects. 
(the Project follows Singelton Design pattern i.e: only one instance can run)
*we still need to do a little  modifications so that it can run on any computer as I'm lacking time to devote to it.

this project was compiled and coded on Ubuntu 12.01 LTS

REQUIREMENTS:
*	2 network interface cards
*	Apache ANT
*	Apache Tomcat (for hosting web pages)
*	Squid Server

CURRENT LIMITATIONS : 
* Since wireless passwords can be obtained using softwares like backtrack.
* routers have a limitation on no of MAC Addresses they can store.
* MAC address can be changed these days using softwares.
* Block certain websites and links.

NEED:
* we need to secure the network against such hostile conditions such that we can give acess to a given gropup of identified people each with identified no of computers.

IDEA
Here we use can use a proxy server but how will it manage about changing MAC addresses or allowing or removing certain pople from a network.
We create a utility such that it controls this Proxy server.

ACHIVEMENTS:
* A secure wireless network (in the worst case the wireless password, username and password of person is stolen)
* A optimization no of connections by creatings sessions.
* Optimizing bandwith.
* caching pages & increasing speed.
* A utility to connect.
* this utility should be created dynamically on users demand.
* it is copy secure (if copied cannot run on other systems).
* The information to check the authentication of computer should not be taken from a file but should be hardcoded and encrypted into the program.
* A web interface to make registrations and change details of authenticated computer.
* A verification mechanism to verify the combination of username, password, and computer requesting connection.

HOW TO INSTALL
*We need to do a little modifications so that it can run on any computer.
*	Use build.xml to build from source.
*	It uses other build.xml (Since we have modulularized the build.xml)
*	run 'sudo ant'

HOW TO GENERATE DOCUMENTATION
use ant docs

YOU CAN USE OTHER OPTIONS, SEE build.xml in this directory only
